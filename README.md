# Introduction
Programmable software (via simple XML files) for real-time controlling of DMX lights, with sequencers and sound-triggers.
You can duplicate and edit the example XML files that are on this project's folder named PublicDocuments and save them wherever you want, as many as you want.
They specify the characteristics, position and direction of each light, and the presets.
When you call DMXCV.Exe (command-line/Run) you can follow it with the path to a XML file.
